    <h1>About TICS</h1>
    <small>Friday, Mar 29, 2019</small>
    <div id="content" class="pt-3">
      <p>Over the past years there has been a greater demand for online censorship and
surveillance, as an understandable reaction against hate speech, copyright
violations, and other cases related to citizen compliance with civil laws and
regulations by national authorities. Unfortunately, this is often accompanied by
a tendency of extensively censoring online content and massively spying on
citizens actions. Numerous whistleblower revelations, leaks from classified
documents, and a vast amount of information released by activists, researchers
and journalists, reveal evidence of government-sponsored infrastructure that
either goes beyond the requirements and scope of the law, or operates without
any effective regulations in place. In addition, this infrastructure often
supports the interests of big private corporations, such as the companies that
enforce online copyright control.</p>

<p>TICS lies within the study area of Internet censorship, surveillance and other
adversarial burdens to technology that bring in danger; to a greater extend the
safety (physical security and privacy) of its users. Proposals for TICS
should be situated within the field of Internet censorship, network
measurements, information controls, surveillance and content moderation.
Ideally topics should connect to the following, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technical, social, political, and economical implications of Internet
censorship and surveillance</li>
<li>Detection and analysis of network blocking and surveillance infrastructure
(hardware or software)</li>
<li>Research on legal frameworks, regulations and policies that imply blocking or
limitation of the availability of network services and online content</li>
<li>Online censorship circumvention and anti-surveillance practices</li>
<li>Network measurements methodologies to detect and categorize network
interference</li>
<li>Research on the implications of automated or centralized user content
regulation (such as for hate speech, copyright, or disinformation)</li>
</ul>

<p>We are interested in exploring the different sociotechnical aspects of
Internet Censorship and Surveillance, hence, we look forward to
academic conferences with different orientations willing to add TICS
as a special track within them.</p>

suggestion, or for any questions regarding the nature of our work.</p>
